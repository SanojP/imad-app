                The club isn't the best place to find a lover
                So the bar is where I go
                Me and my friends at the table doing shots
                Drinking fast and then we talk slow
                Come over and start up a conversation with just me
                And trust me I'll give it a chance now
                Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
                And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
            </p>

                Girl, you know I want your love
                Your love was handmade for somebody like me
                Come on now, follow my lead
                I may be crazy, don't mind me
                Say, boy, let's not talk too much
                Grab on my waist and put that body on me
                Come on now, follow my lead
                Come, come on now, follow my lead
            </p>
